base_annotate
	- cover the remaining options, or at least:
		--objdump
		--modules ?
		--dump-raw-trace
		--symbol; maybe related to kernel
		--asm-raw
		--group
	- try to make some test for semantics

base_list
	- some semantic testing (i.e. are the uncore events there when
	they should? etc.)

base_probe
	- some overload test
		- adding huge amount of probes
		- using huge amount of probes at same time
	- some 'advanced' probing
		- probing variables, args, retvals like watchpoints
		- perf script reporting

base_record
	- create

base_report
	- cover remaining options
	- multiple events reporting
	- tui testing?

base_stat
	- tracepoint events (some of them)
	- more semantic checking
	- grouping events
	- dealing with multithreaded apps and forks
	- multiple attaches and detaches

base_trace
	- --cpu option
	- pagefaults
	- test_syscalls
		- something more deep for the syscalls; like strace-any
		- would be non-trivial to have it really multiarch
	- no-syscalls - specify other events as well; tracepoint events
	- dealing with forks/threads
	- overload

other commands to cover:
	- archive
	- bench
	- buildid-cache & buildid-list
	- diff
	- evlist
	- inject
	- kmem
	- kvm ?
	- lock
	- mem
	- sched
	- script
	- timechart ?
	- top
